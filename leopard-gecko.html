    <h1>Leopard Gecko Care Guide</h1>

    <div class="info-box">
      Leopard geckos, also referred to as leos, are small, colorful reptiles with a generally docile, slow-moving nature. They can be distinguished by the color and pattern of their tail, which features 
        a combination of black stripes and spots on their backs and tails. A variety of morphs and mutations alter their coloration, leading to a wide range of prices at reptile retailers and expos. Typically, 
        these reptiles cost between $100-$250 USD, depending on the morph and age. A minimum 40-gallon enclosure is required, furnished with either paper towels or a well-mixed semiarid substrate. 
        Leopard geckos are crepuscular/nocturnal, meaning they are usually inactive during the day and more active at dusk, although they may not always adhere to this sleep pattern. As insectivores, they 
        need an enclosure that features both humid and dry areas. With proper care, leopard geckos can live between 15 and 20 years. Their ease of care, extensive captive-breeding efforts, and docile nature 
        make them an ideal choice for beginners interested in reptile-keeping.
    </div>

    <h2>Species Info</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
      Leopard Geckos, or Eublepharis macularius, are a species of gecko found in the deserts of the Middle East and southwestern Asia. More specifically, their native habitat range includes the rocky, 
      dry grasslands and desert regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and parts of Iran. As previously mentioned, they are known for their distinctive spots and gentle nature. In the wild, 
      leos gather most of their heat from rocks warmed by the sun throughout the day. They are smaller than many other reptiles, with hatchlings typically measuring anywhere from 3 to 4 inches (7-10 cm) long. 
      Adults reach full size at around 12-18 months, with females growing to 7-8 inches (18-20 cm) and males to 8-11 inches (20-28 cm). Their toes do not contain any adhesive like that found in tree-dwelling geckos, so they 
      cannot climb smooth walls. Leopard geckos have distinctly thick tails that store fat and extra energy, similar to camel humps. This is part of what makes them such a great beginner-friendly 
      reptile, as they can typically go several days in a row without meals. When hunting, leos sometimes lift their tails in a wagging motion as they approach their prey. Leos can also make faint 
      chirping noises when they are curious, excited, or nervous. They can also drop their tails when threatened. This is a voluntary response to stimuli, not an instict, so they will only do this when
      they are extraordinarily stressed. Like all reptiles, they shed their skin. They also eat their skin, in order to retain the nutrients from the shed. Unlike most other geckos, leos have eyelids.
    </div>

    <h2>Habitat Size Requirements</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
      Leopard Geckos need a habitat that is at least 40 gallons in size for a single gecko. This species MUST be kept alone, it absolutely cannot be kept with other leos or other species of reptile. They 
      do not have strict humidity requirements, and can be kept at anywhere between 30%-50% humidity. That being said, they must have a "humid hide," or a damp, dark place where they can shed their skin. They
      will require several hiding holes and rocks, to allow the animal to hide when stressed while also helping in regulating leos' body temperatures. They also enjoy climbing "steps," such as layered rocks or 
      short artificial decorations.
    </div>

    <h2>Heating Requirements</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
      Leopard Geckos require a temperature gradient in their enclosure, with a warm side between 88-92°F (31-33°C) and a cool side around 70-75°F (21-24°C). Although debatably necessary, it is not harmful 
      to introduce a small amount UVB lighting for your animal. We recommend the Zoo Med ReptiSun T5 HO 5.0. This assists leos in processing the calcium they need to grow healthily. Other than this recommendation, 
      they do not require visible light to live happy, healthy lives. See the enrichment section below for optional lighting recommendations.
