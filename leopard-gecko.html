    <p>
      Leopard geckos, also referred to as leos, are small, colorful reptiles with a generally docile, 
      slow-moving nature. They can be distinguished by the color and pattern of their tail, which 
      features a combination of black stripes and spots on their backs and tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      A variety of morphs and mutations alter their coloration, leading to a wide range of prices 
      at reptile retailers and expos. Typically, these reptiles cost between $100-$250 USD, 
      depending on the morph and age. A minimum 40-gallon enclosure is required, furnished with 
      either paper towels or a well-mixed semiarid substrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leopard geckos are crepuscular/nocturnal, meaning they are usually inactive during the day 
      and more active at dusk, although they may not always adhere to this sleep pattern. Leos are 
      insectivores, and they need an enclosure that features both humid and dry areas. With proper 
      care, leopard geckos can live between 15 and 20 years. Their ease of care, extensive 
      captive-breeding efforts, and docile nature make them an ideal choice for beginners 
      interested in reptile-keeping.
    </p>

      <div id="speciesInfo" class="section-content">
        <p>
          <strong>Leopard Geckos (Eublepharis macularius)</strong> are found in the deserts of the Middle East 
          and southwestern Asia. More specifically, their native habitat range includes the rocky, dry grasslands 
          and desert regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and parts of Iran. They are known for their 
          distinctive spots and gentle nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the wild, leos gather most of their heat from rocks warmed by the sun throughout the day. 
          They are smaller than many other reptiles, with hatchlings typically measuring anywhere from 
          3 to 4 inches (7-10 cm) long. Adults reach full size at around 12-18 months, with females growing 
          to 7-8 inches (18-20 cm) and males to 8-11 inches (20-28 cm).
        </p>
        <p>
          Their toes do not contain adhesive pads like tree-dwelling geckos, so they cannot climb smooth walls. 
          Leopard geckos have distinctly thick tails that store fat and extra energy, similar to camel humps. 
          This makes them beginner-friendly, as they can go several days without meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          When hunting, leos sometimes lift their tails in a wagging motion as they approach prey. They can also 
          make faint chirping noises when curious, excited, or nervous, and can drop their tails if threatened. 
          Like all reptiles, they shed their skin and eat it to retain nutrients. Unlike most other geckos, 
          leos have eyelids.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="habitatSize" class="section-content">
        <p>
          Leopard Geckos need a habitat that is at least 40 gallons in size for a single gecko. This species 
          MUST be kept alone; it absolutely cannot be kept with other leos or other reptile species. They do 
          not have strict humidity requirements and can be kept at anywhere between 30%-50% humidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they must have a "humid hide," or a damp, dark place where they can shed their skin. They 
          require several hiding holes and rocks to hide when stressed and to help regulate body temperature. 
          They also enjoy climbing "steps," such as layered rocks or short artificial decorations. Ensure that 
          the enclosure is regularly cleaned of waste to maintain the health of your leo.

    <div class="content-area">
      <div id="heatingReqs" class="section-content">
        <p>
          Leopard Geckos require a temperature gradient in their enclosure, with a warm side between 
          88-92°F (31-33°C) and a cool side around 70-75°F (21-24°C). Although debatable, a small amount 
          of UVB lighting (e.g., Zoo Med ReptiSun T5 HO 5.0) can assist in calcium processing and is generally 
          not harmful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than this recommendation, they do not require visible light to live happily. 
          See the enrichment section for optional lighting ideas.

      </div>
      <div id="humidityAirflow" class="section-content">
        <p>
          Leopard Geckos thrive in low-medium humidity environments, typically around 30%-50%. 
          A mesh top enclosure is ideal to achieve this range and provide good ventilation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional fans may be added for enrichment or to assist with humidity control, but they are 
          optional in most home environments.

          Leopard Geckos primarily eat insects such as crickets, mealworms, and dubia roaches. 
          Dust their food with calcium every feeding and vitamin D3 (unless using UVB lighting, then you can 
          dust every other feeding) to prevent metabolic bone disease and allow for healthy growth.

          Provide plenty of hiding spots, climbing structures, and a well-mixed semiarid or paper towel 
          substrate to keep your Leopard Gecko engaged and comfortable. If you opt for a mixed substrate, 
          use a blend of 50% coconut fiber, 20% clean playsand, 20% topsoil, and 10% clay, allowing for 
          digging behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensure the enclosure is regularly cleaned of waste if using a naturalistic substrate.
