    <!-- Intro paragraph remains visible -->
    <p>
      Leopard geckos, also referred to as leos, are small, colorful reptiles with a generally docile, slow-moving nature.
      They can be distinguished by the color and pattern of their tail, which features a combination of black stripes and 
      spots on their backs and tails. A variety of morphs and mutations alter their coloration, leading to a wide range 
      of prices at reptile retailers and expos. Typically, these reptiles cost between $100-$250 USD, depending on the 
      morph and age. A minimum 40-gallon enclosure is required, furnished with either paper towels or a well-mixed 
      semiarid substrate. Leopard geckos are crepuscular/nocturnal, meaning they are usually inactive during the day 
      and more active at dusk, although they may not always adhere to this sleep pattern. Leos are insectivores, and they 
      need an enclosure that features both humid and dry areas. With proper care, leopard geckos can live between 15 and 
      20 years. Their ease of care, extensive captive-breeding efforts, and docile nature make them an ideal choice for 
      beginners interested in reptile-keeping.

    <div id="speciesInfo" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        <strong>Leopard Geckos (Eublepharis macularius)</strong> are found in the deserts of the Middle East and 
        southwestern Asia. More specifically, their native habitat range includes the rocky, dry grasslands and desert 
        regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and parts of Iran. They are known for their distinctive spots 
        and gentle nature. In the wild, leos gather most of their heat from rocks warmed by the sun throughout the day. 
        They are smaller than many other reptiles, with hatchlings typically measuring anywhere from 3 to 4 inches 
        (7-10 cm) long. Adults reach full size at around 12-18 months, with females growing to 7-8 inches (18-20 cm) 
        and males to 8-11 inches (20-28 cm). Their toes do not contain adhesive pads like tree-dwelling geckos, so 
        they cannot climb smooth walls. Leopard geckos have distinctly thick tails that store fat and extra energy, 
        similar to camel humps. This makes them beginner-friendly, as they can go several days without meals. When 
        hunting, leos sometimes lift their tails in a wagging motion as they approach prey. They can also make faint 
        chirping noises when curious, excited, or nervous, and can drop their tails if threatened. Like all reptiles, 
        they shed their skin and eat it to retain nutrients. Unlike most other geckos, leos have eyelids.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="habitatSize" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        Leopard Geckos need a habitat that is at least 40 gallons in size for a single gecko. This species MUST be 
        kept alone; it absolutely cannot be kept with other leos or other reptile species. They do not have strict 
        humidity requirements and can be kept at anywhere between 30%-50% humidity. However, they must have a "humid 
        hide," or a damp, dark place where they can shed their skin. They require several hiding holes and rocks to 
        hide when stressed and to help regulate body temperature. They also enjoy climbing "steps," such as layered 
        rocks or short artificial decorations. Ensure that the enclosure is regularly cleaned of waste to maintain 
        the health of your leo.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="heatingReqs" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        Leopard Geckos require a temperature gradient in their enclosure, with a warm side between 88-92°F (31-33°C) 
        and a cool side around 70-75°F (21-24°C). Although debatable, a small amount of UVB lighting (e.g., Zoo Med 
        ReptiSun T5 HO 5.0) can assist in calcium processing and is generally not harmful. Other than this 
        recommendation, they do not require visible light to live happily. See the enrichment section for optional 
        lighting ideas.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="humidityAirflow" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        Leopard Geckos thrive in low-medium humidity environments, typically around 30%-50%. A mesh top enclosure 
        is ideal to achieve this range and provide good ventilation. Additional fans may be added for enrichment 
        or to assist with humidity control, but they are optional in most home environments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="foodReqs" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        Leopard Geckos primarily eat insects such as crickets, mealworms, and dubia roaches. Dust their food with 
        calcium every feeding and vitamin D3 (unless using UVB lighting, then you can dust every other feeding) to 
        prevent metabolic bone disease and allow for healthy growth.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="enrichment" class="info-box hidden">
      <p>
        Provide plenty of hiding spots, climbing structures, and a well-mixed semiarid or paper towel substrate to 
        keep your Leopard Gecko engaged and comfortable. If you opt for a mixed substrate, use a blend of 50% 
        coconut fiber, 20% clean playsand, 20% topsoil, and 10% clay, allowing for digging behavior. Ensure the 
        enclosure is regularly cleaned of waste if using a naturalistic substrate.
