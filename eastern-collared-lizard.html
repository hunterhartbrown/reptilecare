        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Eastern Collared Lizard Care Guide</h1>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Species Info</h2>
            <p>Collared lizards (Crotaphytus spp.) are medium-sized lizards native to the American Southwest, Mexico, and the Baja peninsula. They are known for their vibrant colors, particularly the males, and their distinct “collar” marking around the neck. These lizards are highly active and thrive in hot, rocky environments. With proper care, they can live for over 10 years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Habitat Size Requirements</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards need a habitat that is at least 36" L x 18" W x 16" H (90 x 45 x 45cm) in size, with front-opening doors for easy access. The enclosure should be well-ventilated with a mesh top to allow for proper airflow. Since these lizards are very active, a larger enclosure is always better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Lighting & UVB</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards are diurnal, requiring strong, high-quality UVB lighting to thrive. Use a T5 HO UVB bulb like the Arcadia Desert 12% or Zoo Med Reptisun 10.0, covering half the length of the enclosure and mounted in a reflective fixture. Position the basking area so the lizard's back is 8-12 inches below the UVB lamp if mounted over mesh, or 14-16 inches below if under mesh. Ensure they receive a UV Index of 4.0-6.0 in their basking area.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">General Illumination</h2>
            <p>Provide bright light with a color temperature of around 6500K to simulate daylight, which supports their mental and physical health. Full-spectrum lighting, such as the Arcadia Jungle Dawn LED Bar, will help keep your lizard active and alert.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Heating Requirements</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards require a basking surface temperature of 104-118°F (40-48°C) and a cool side temperature of 77-90°F (25-32°C). At night, temperatures can drop to 68-79°F (20-26°C). A halogen heat lamp with two 50w PAR30 bulbs is recommended, positioned about 8-12 inches above the basking platform. Adjust the height or use a dimmer to maintain proper temperatures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Humidity & Airflow</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards prefer a dry environment with humidity levels between 30-50%. Regular misting is not necessary for western species, but it can be done occasionally. A digital hygrometer can help monitor humidity levels. Ensure good airflow to prevent mold and mildew.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Substrate</h2>
            <p>Use a naturalistic substrate such as a mix of clean topsoil and fine sand, packed to a depth of 4 inches for burrowing. Other options include Jurassic Reptile Substrate, Zoo Med ReptiSand, or Exo Terra Desert Sand. Replace the substrate every 3-4 months, and spot-clean daily to remove waste.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Enclosure Décor</h2>
            <p>Provide plenty of environmental enrichment items, such as cork bark, branches, rocks, and live plants, to encourage natural behaviors. This not only stimulates your lizard's instincts but also enhances the visual appeal of the enclosure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Food Requirements</h2>
            <p>Collared lizards are primarily insectivores and should be fed a variety of insects like crickets, mealworms, and dubia roaches daily. It's best to let them hunt their prey rather than offering it in a dish. Occasionally, offer small vertebrates or vegetation. Supplement their diet with calcium and multivitamin powders to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Supplements</h2>
            <p>Use a calcium powder and multivitamin supplement to ensure your lizard gets all the essential nutrients. Brands like Arcadia Earthpro or Repashy Calcium Plus LoD are excellent options. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Water</h2>
            <p>Provide a small bowl of fresh water at all times. Although collared lizards get most of their moisture from their food, it's important to ensure they have access to water, especially during warmer months.</p>
