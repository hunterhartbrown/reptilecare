        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Eastern Collared Lizard Care Guide</h1>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Species Overview</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards (Crotaphytus spp.) are medium-sized lizards native to the American Southwest, Mexico, and the Baja peninsula. They are recognized for their vibrant colors and distinct “collar” marking around the neck. These lizards are highly active and thrive in hot, rocky environments. With proper care, they can live for over 10 years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Coloration and Patterns</h2>
            <p>Collared lizards exhibit a variety of colors depending on sex and species, ranging from tan or gray to bright aquamarine and yellow. Males tend to be more colorful than females, and they typically feature speckling and dark collar-like stripes around their necks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Enclosure Size</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards need a habitat that is at least 36" L x 18" W x 16" H (90 x 45 x 45cm) in size, with front-opening doors for easy access. The enclosure should be well-ventilated with a mesh top to allow for proper airflow. Since these lizards are very active, a larger enclosure is always better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Enclosure Setup</h2>
            <p>As sun-loving lizards, Eastern Collared Lizards thrive in enclosures that provide ample opportunities for climbing and basking. Include branches, rocks, and other structures to mimic their natural rocky terrain. Use a naturalistic substrate such as a mix of clean topsoil and fine sand, packed to a depth of 4 inches for burrowing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Temperature Requirements</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards require a basking surface temperature of 104-118°F (40-48°C) and a cool side temperature of 77-90°F (25-32°C). At night, temperatures can drop to 68-79°F (20-26°C). A halogen heat lamp with two 50w PAR30 bulbs is recommended, positioned about 8-12 inches above the basking platform. Adjust the height or use a dimmer to maintain proper temperatures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Humidity and Ventilation</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards prefer a dry environment with humidity levels between 30-50%. Western species may thrive with even lower humidity. Ensure good airflow to prevent mold and mildew, and monitor humidity levels with a digital hygrometer. A humid hide can be provided on the cool side of the enclosure, especially during shedding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Dietary Needs</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards are primarily insectivores, thriving on a varied diet of crickets, mealworms, and other insects. Offer live prey daily and ensure it is gut-loaded and dusted with calcium and vitamin supplements. Occasionally, they may be offered small vertebrates or vegetation as part of their diet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Size and Lifespan</h2>
            <p>Eastern Collared Lizards can grow to a length of 8-14 inches (20-36cm). With proper care, they can live for over 10 years, making them a long-term commitment for reptile enthusiasts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Sexing and Breeding</h2>
            <p>You can distinguish male collared lizards by their more vibrant coloration and the presence of hemipenal bulges at the base of their tails. Males are territorial and should generally not be housed together. If breeding, house one male with multiple females in a larger enclosure to minimize conflict.</p>
