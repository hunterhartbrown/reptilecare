Gargoyle Gecko,Habitat,12x12x12,50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/caring-for-pet-gargoyle-geckos-5120265,"Fortunately, you're not going to need a significantly large enclosure for the gargoyle gecko. While it's possible to house them in a 10-gallon tank, a larger reptile vivarium (aim for at least 12x12x12) is recommended. Either glass or plastic will assist with humidity retention, and you may want to look for a front-facing door and vents.","['\\b\\d+x\\d+x\\d+\\b', '\\b\\d+ gallons?\\b', '\\b\\d+\\s?(inches|in|cm|centimeters|feet|ft)\\b']"

Aim to have their light on for about 12 hours a day.","['\\b\\d+\\s?hours?\\b', '\\b\\d+\\s?hrs?\\b']"
