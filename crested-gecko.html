        <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #000;">Crested Gecko Care Guide</h1>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Species Overview</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus) originate from the southern parts of New Caledonia, an island group located east of Australia. These geckos are recognizable by the crest-like ridges above their eyes and along their heads, earning them the nickname "Eyelash Geckos." Once believed to be extinct, they were rediscovered in 1994 and have since become a popular species in the pet trade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Coloration and Patterns</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos exhibit a wide range of colors and patterns, from shades of brown, cream, and black to vibrant oranges, reds, and whites. Some may be solid in color, while others showcase spots or stripes. With ongoing captive breeding, increasingly diverse and unique color and pattern variations, known as "morphs," are being developed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Enclosure Size</h2>
            <p>A single adult or a pair of crested geckos can thrive in a 20-gallon tank or an 18x18x24 terrarium. Juvenile geckos should be housed individually until they reach sexual maturity, as they can be territorial. Males should never be housed together, but a single male can cohabitate with one or more females if the enclosure is spacious enough.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Enclosure Setup</h2>
            <p>As arboreal creatures, crested geckos benefit from enclosures that offer vertical space for climbing. Include branches, vines, and other climbing structures to cater to their natural instincts. Coco fiber or bioactive substrates, like Josh’s Frogs Tropical BioBedding, are excellent choices. Keep the substrate moist but not overly wet. Ideal temperatures range from 74-78°F, with humidity levels maintained between 60-70%.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Temperature Requirements</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos thrive at room temperatures of 72-78°F. Supplemental heating is generally unnecessary unless temperatures fall below 65°F. While they can handle brief periods of higher temperatures, exposure to temperatures above 85°F should be avoided. Heating elements are usually not required unless the ambient temperature deviates significantly from the recommended range.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Humidity and Ventilation</h2>
            <p>Maintaining appropriate humidity is essential for crested geckos’ health. Aim for humidity levels between 60-70%. Regular misting and ensuring good ventilation within the enclosure will help achieve this. Always provide fresh water and monitor both humidity and temperature with a digital thermometer/hygrometer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Dietary Needs</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos are omnivores, enjoying a diet of both fruit and insects. Commercially available diets like Pangea and Repashy fruit mixes are excellent staples. Additionally, offer live insects such as crickets or dubia roaches on a weekly basis. Ensure all feeder insects are gut-loaded and dusted with vitamin/mineral supplements before feeding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Size and Lifespan</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos can reach a length of 7-9 inches, including their tail. Although they may drop their tail when stressed, it does not regenerate. With proper care, they can live for 15-20 years in captivity. Juveniles are typically around 4-5 inches long when sold.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-guide-section">
            <h2 style="color: #000;">Sexing and Breeding</h2>
            <p>You can identify the sex of a crested gecko by the presence of bulges at the base of the tail in males. They typically reach sexual maturity between 1.5-2 years of age. The breeding season usually runs from December to August, during which females lay two eggs every 30-45 days. It’s advisable to separate males from females after the breeding season to allow the females time to recuperate.</p>
