      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crested_gecko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus)</a> are gentle, arboreal lizards from New Caledonia. Famous for their eyelash-like crests and prehensile tails, they thrive in home vivariums and make engaging pets for keepers of all experience levels.
    </p>
    <p class="rc-species-text">
      Long believed extinct, crested geckos were rediscovered in 1994 and have become beloved worldwide. With careful breeding, morphs in a spectrum of colors and patterns are now available, making every gecko unique!

          Crested geckos are native to the southern forests of New Caledonia, east of Australia. Their prominent eyelash-like crests and prehensile tails help them navigate branches and leaves. These geckos are available in a dazzling range of colors and patterns, from soft earth tones to bold oranges, reds, and whites. Males are best housed separately due to territoriality, while females may be grouped in larger enclosures.

      </div>
      <div id="habitatSize" class="rc-species-section">
        <p>
          One adult (or a pair) can thrive in a <strong>20-gallon tank</strong> or an <strong>18×18×24" terrarium</strong>. Juveniles should be housed separately until mature, as they may fight. Never house males together, but a male can be kept with females if the enclosure is spacious and well-planted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provide plenty of vertical space and climbing opportunities using branches, vines, and cork bark. Coco fiber or bioactive substrates support humidity and digging. Keep substrate moist (not soggy).

          Crested geckos do best at <strong>72–78°F</strong>. Supplemental heating is only needed if your home drops below 65°F. Avoid temps over 85°F. Use a thermometer to monitor conditions—usually, room temperature suffices.

      <div id="humidityAirflow" class="rc-species-section">
        <p>
          Target humidity: <strong>60–70%</strong>. Mist the enclosure 1–2 times daily to maintain humidity, but allow the enclosure to dry out between mistings. Good ventilation is critical for health—use a mesh top and monitor with a hygrometer. Always provide fresh water.

          Offer a mix of fruit-based commercial diets (e.g., Pangea, Repashy) as the staple. Supplement with live insects (crickets, dubia roaches) weekly—gut-load and dust insects with calcium and vitamins. Remove uneaten food promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always provide a shallow dish of fresh water, cleaned daily. Water dishes also create slight humidity, which can be beneficial near hides.

      <div id="enrichment" class="rc-species-section">
        <p>
          Crested geckos grow to <strong>7–9 inches</strong>, including tail. They may drop (and not regrow) their tails if stressed. With proper care, expect lifespans of <strong>15–20 years</strong>. Juveniles are sold at about 4–5 inches in length.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enrichment promotes natural behaviors: include multiple hides, climbing structures, and visual barriers using cork bark and artificial plants. Males develop bulges at the tail base and mature at 1.5–2 years. Periodically rearrange decor for novelty to encourage exploration.
