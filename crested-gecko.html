            <h2 style="color: #000;">Species Info</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos (Correlophus ciliatus) are native to southern New Caledonia, an island chain east of Australia. Known for the crest-like projections that adorn their head and eyes, they are also called "Eyelash Geckos." Once thought to be extinct, they were rediscovered in 1994 and have since become one of the most widely kept gecko species in captivity.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Coloration & Patterns</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos come in a variety of colors and patterns, ranging from brown, cream, and black to oranges, reds, and whites. Some geckos are patternless, while others feature spots or stripes. As captive breeding continues, more unique color and pattern combinations, known as "morphs," are becoming available.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Habitat Size Requirements</h2>
            <p>A single adult or pair of crested geckos can be housed in a 20-gallon tank or an 18x18x24 terrarium. It is essential to house young geckos individually until they are sexually mature, as they can be territorial and aggressive towards one another. Males should not be housed together, but one male can be kept with one or multiple females if there is enough space.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Habitat</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos are arboreal and thrive in environments with vertical space for climbing. Include branches, vines, and other structures to satisfy their climbing instincts. Coco fiber or bioactive substrates, such as Josh’s Frogs Tropical BioBedding, are ideal. Keep the substrate moist but not soaking wet. The ideal temperature range is 74-78°F, and humidity should be maintained between 60-70%.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Heating Requirements</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos do well at room temperatures between 72-78°F. They do not require additional heating unless temperatures drop below 65°F. While they can tolerate brief periods of higher temperatures, they should never be exposed to temperatures above 85°F. Heating elements are generally unnecessary unless ambient temperatures fall outside the recommended range.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Humidity / Airflow Requirements</h2>
            <p>Maintaining proper humidity is crucial for the health of crested geckos. Aim for a humidity level between 60-70%. Regular misting and a well-ventilated enclosure will help achieve this. Provide fresh water in a reptile water bowl and monitor humidity and temperature with a digital thermometer/hygrometer.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Food Requirements</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos are omnivorous, feeding on both fruit and insects. Commercial diets like Pangea and Repashy fruit mixes are excellent staples, and live insects like crickets or dubia roaches can be offered weekly. Ensure all feeder insects are gut-loaded and dusted with a vitamin/mineral supplement before feeding.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Size and Age</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos can grow up to 7-9 inches in length, including their tail. While they may drop their tail when threatened, it does not regenerate. In captivity, they can live up to 15-20 years with proper care. Juveniles are typically around 4-5 inches long when sold.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #000;">Sexing and Breeding</h2>
            <p>Crested geckos can be sexed by the presence of bulges at the base of the tail in males. They reach sexual maturity at 1.5-2 years of age. Breeding season usually lasts from December to August, during which females lay 2 eggs every 30-45 days. It is recommended to separate males from females after the breeding season to allow the females time to recover.</p>
